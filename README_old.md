# Benchmarking Global Optimization Algorithms

##
This project contains a benchmarking experiment. We compare a collection of different optimization algorithms which are implemented within the NLOPT library. Our project reports **data-profiles,deviation-profiles and performance profiles**.<br> The benchmarking experiment follows in great parts the methodology outlined in the following paper:<br>

Another great part of our project is devoted to the implementation of two optimization algorithms. We successfully implemented the **Newton root finding method** and the **Nelder Mead** optimization algorithm by ourself. These algorithms are not included in the benchmarking experiment, due to the fact that they still require a lot of solving time. This solving time would be huge if we would apply these algorithms on our benchmarking experiment. However these algorithms are successfully implemented and are capable to solve test problems. We will continue to work in order to increase the speed of these algorithms.

## Structure of notebook

Section two of our project notebook begins with an introduction to the topic of global optimization. In this section the general optimization problem is formulated that we face for the benchmarking experiment. Section three explains the difference between derivative free algorithms an gradient based algorithms. This section also explains in detail which algorithms were included in our benchmarking experiment and how these algorithms were configurated. In section four a detailed overview is given about the test problems considered in Guvenen et al. (2019). This section is followed by a detailed explanation of our benchmarking approach (section 5). Our results are presented in section 6. Here we report **data-profiles and deviation profiles** and in subsection 6.5 we report **performance profiles** which are based on the four test problems considered in Guvenen et al. (2019). Section seven is an extension, in which we extend the collection of test problems considered. We include the Ackley function, Zakharov function and Easom function. The quality of the study conducted by Guvenen et al. (2019) is discussed in section eight. In section nine we provide an economic application. We employ two algorithms of the NLOPT library in order to minimize the volatility of a three asset portfolio. Section ten concludes.

## Repository

This project is created using a python environment. The results are represented in the notebook [student_project.ipynb](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-scientific-computing-course-wirecard/blob/master/student_project.ipynb) which is in the main branch of this repository. The best way to view all contents of this study, is to download the whole Github repository [ose-scientific-computing-wirecard](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-scientific-computing-course-wirecard). NBviewer and other viewing options like my-Binder **may not display all illustrations fully as in a local jupyter-notebook environment**. But the best way to view this project online should be via my-Binder. The results generated by our analysis can be found in the folder [data/Results](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-scientific-computing-course-wirecard/tree/master/data/Results). The notebooks (and seeeds) which were used in order to generate the results can be found in the folder [data/dat_generation_files](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-scientific-computing-course-wirecard/tree/master/data/dat_generation_files). The auxiliary files necessary for the project notebook and for the result generation can be found in the folder [auxiliary/aux_m](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-scientific-computing-course-wirecard/tree/master/auxiliary/aux_m). All other files in the auxiliary file are files for the algorithms we implemented by ourselves. The results for the economic application can be found in the folder [data/application_result](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ose-scientific-computing-course-wirecard/tree/master/data/application_result). In these result folders we do not only provide the results, we also provide the starting points which were used.
